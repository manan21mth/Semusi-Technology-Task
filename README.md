We can conclude  that it is possible to classify employees at check-in using their smartphone by taking data from Physics Toolbox and then sending it to our model(with the required pre-processing) for class prediction about the identity of the person. If it matches with some previous data then we let them in.

This could improve the checking experience with great accuracy(security).
